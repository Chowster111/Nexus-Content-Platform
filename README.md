# 🚀 Engineering Blog Recommender

**A production-ready, AI-powered content recommendation system that discovers, classifies, tags, embeds, and delivers over 10,000 articles from world-leading engineering blogs.**  
Built for real-time semantic search, personalized recommendations, and developer insights — with scalable architecture, robust error handling, and modern observability baked in.

## 🗄️ Backend Stack: FastAPI + Supabase + PostgreSQL
The backend is built using FastAPI, a modern Python web framework known for its speed, async support, and developer-friendly automatic OpenAPI docs.

All structured data — including articles, embeddings metadata, user likes, and auth records — is stored in a PostgreSQL database hosted via Supabase, which acts as a backend-as-a-service with instant REST endpoints, row-level security, and authentication.

This design means:

✅ Strong typing and validation for all API endpoints via Pydantic models.

✅ Serverless auth & storage — Supabase handles user sessions, JWTs, and real-time updates.

✅ Scalable Postgres — Flexible SQL database with vector extension support if needed.

Together, FastAPI + Supabase + PostgreSQL keep the backend fast, type-safe, and ready to scale — without sacrificing observability, retries, or robust error handling.
